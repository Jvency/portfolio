Experiment8
1.In first program, we find out the bytes having complemented nibbles from an array of 10 bytes and store them into new array in memory.
2.The second program, the counting of positive numbers, negative numbers and zeroes in an array of 20 bytes is performed along with finding the maximum numbers, which all are stored back to memory.

Experiment 9
1.The program separates the numbers ranging in 2010 and 4010 in an array of 10 numbers and the separated numbers are stored back into memory.
2.The second program illustrate sorting of an array in descending order.

Experiment 10
1.In the first program, the redundancy of elements is removed and the compressed array is stored back into memory.
In the second program, packing of two unpacked BCD numbers stored in memory is performed and result is stored back into memory.
